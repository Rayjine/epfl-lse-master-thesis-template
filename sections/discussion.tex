\section{Discussion}

\noindent This section provides a concise interpretation of the results in relation to the study objectives. Emphasis is placed on what the findings suggest, how robust they appear under the chosen validation strategy, and how they fit within a broader life sciences context.

\noindent Replace this placeholder with project\,specific discussion points: main takeaways, practical implications, limitations (data, methods, assumptions), and prioritized future directions. Clearly distinguish evidence\,based claims from speculation, and note any dependencies that may affect generalizability.
