\section{Introduction}

\noindent This template provides a brief, generic introduction suitable for an EPFL School of Life Sciences master thesis. It motivates the need for clear, reproducible, and data\,driven analyses without binding the thesis to a specific application.

\noindent The following chapters outline a general methodology, present representative results, and discuss implications and limitations. Replace this placeholder with project\,specific objectives, datasets, and contributions.
