\section{Conclusion}

\noindent This section provides a brief synthesis of the work and its contributions. In its generic form, it highlights that a reproducible, data\,driven methodology was presented, representative results were obtained, and practical lessons were drawn for life sciences applications.

\noindent Replace this placeholder with project\,specific takeaways: summarize the main findings without restating all details, note limitations that matter most, and outline concrete next steps (e.g., additional validation, broader datasets, or methodological extensions).
