\section{Results}

\noindent This section summarizes representative outcomes at a high level, focusing on patterns aligned with the study objectives and on robustness checks (e.g., cross\,validation, external validation, and uncertainty estimates).

\noindent Replace this placeholder with project\,specific findings: key metrics and confidence intervals, brief references to figures/tables, and observations relevant to the research questions. Avoid over\,claiming; note caveats that affect interpretation and generalizability.
