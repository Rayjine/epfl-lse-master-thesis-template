# EPFL LSE Master Thesis Template
This repository provides a **LaTeX template** specifically designed for **Master’s students in Life Sciences Engineering (LSE)** at EPFL.

It includes:

* A clean structure for front matter (title page, abstract, acknowledgments), main chapters, appendices, and bibliography.
* Consistent formatting for sections, figures, tables, and equations.
* Preconfigured style files, make/build scripts, and examples.
  
⚠️ Note: This is *not* an official EPFL template, but a community resource. Always double-check with your thesis supervisor or department for any mandatory formatting rules.
